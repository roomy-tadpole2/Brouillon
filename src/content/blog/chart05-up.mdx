A GO enrichment heatmap for upregulated genes. The heatmap is generated using seaborn's clustermap function, which provides a visual representation of the enrichment of GO terms across different groups. The color intensity in the heatmap corresponds to the -log10(p-value) of the enrichment, allowing for easy identification of significantly enriched GO terms.
